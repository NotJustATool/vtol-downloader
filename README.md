# vtol-downloader

This program is a tool to download and "decrypt"
[VTOL VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/667970/VTOL_VR/) workshop files.
The "encryption" is a simple encoding that is easily reversed.

## Usage
1. Download the release from [the releases page](https://github.com/notjustatool/vtol-downloader/releases).
2. Extract the contents of the zip and open a command prompt to that location.
3. Run `vtol-downloader.exe --help` for how to operate the program.

## Troubleshooting
You must be logged into the Steam client on your computer with an account that *owns* VTOL VR. You must also not be in offline mode. If you still have issues, make sure `steam_api64.dll` is beside the executable. You can contact me on Discord at `JustATool#9911` if you have further questions.
